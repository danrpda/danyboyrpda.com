      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Well and managed data information about for the 
        whole network system under EEU has a great importance to optimize, manage 
        and make some analysis for different scenarios. Now a days data is a big 
        issue in any sector to facilitate the ongoing process work to mitigate 
        the final goals sited by the organization. A GIS (Geographical Information 
        System) is a passionate software tool that handle all the data referenced 
        to a particular task, specially belongs to geo-spacial referenced database 
        system. In EEU(Ethiopian Electric Utility), concerning to 66KV High Voltage 
        system, 15KV or 33KV Medium voltage system and a 220V/380V Low Voltage 
        system, there is a big need to manipulate, optimize, and analyze for different 
        assets throughout the whole system. This because EEU has a plan to mitigate 
        the sited goals by consecutive gross transformational plan I, II &#8230;III 
        by 2030 GC, to electrify rural Towns/Villages in each Woredas under different 
        regions and plan to reach 90% of electrification for the total population 
        of the country, Ethiopia. Upon this factor a GIS tool is important to 
        make the required analysis that the way how to plan for electrification 
        system either from the Grid or Off-Grid system. <br>
        The overall truth that the data for Substation, MV (15KV and 33KV) and 
        LV (220V/380V) in all regions of Ethiopia, which are available by EEU 
        are more or less insufficient for our need. In fact there is ongoing process 
        to collect geo-spacial MV (15KV and 33KV) network information from the 
        field and produce a model geo-map by NRECA International (USAID FUND) 
        company and a World Bank consultant. Now under this project plan and implementation, 
        we will go to prepare LV Network geo-data management and make it ready 
        for further Network Planning and Editing as well as for different network 
        optimization and analysis purpose. For Geo-data collection required devices 
        like handheld GPS (Geographical Positioning System) or Smart Mobile Phones 
        using ODK Software or using OSMTrucker software and satellite maps using 
        Google Map are very necessary for best project accomplishment. <br>
        This project should undergo through three phases. <br>
        ? The first phase is building all infrastructures and system configuration 
        at central and region UEAP offices.<br>
        ? The second phase is installation of GeoNode, pgAdmin, QGIS or ESRI GIS, 
        PuTTY client software, supportive system like geoserver, git etc&#8230;, 
        Geo-Data Collection and implementation of the above listed softwares for 
        geo-data management and analysis.<br>
        ? The third phase is network planning and editing with best planning software 
        like NEPLAN or ETAB and network profile software like PLSCAD or any other.<br>
        So in order to collect and organize the LV Network geo-data by own force, 
        there are some requirements so as to satisfy our need. Among them the 
        following basic necessities are listed below:<br>
        1) A WAN QGIS system to be installed in each Central and Regions UEAP&#8217;s 
        (Universal Electric Access Program) offices need different devices on 
        the network.<br>
        ? A client WAN QGIS System in each Regions UEAP&#8217;s office.<br>
        ? A central main QGIS Server at Central UEAP office.<br>
        ? Internet Cables, Routers, hubs, switches, Wifi apparatus, Modem apparatus, 
        Server (either desktop or Spacial server), Racks, DSL cables, Ethiopian 
        Telecommunication DSL Line or Broad band line. <br>
        2) A genuine ESRI GIS Software for all Central and Regions UEAP offices 
        or an open source QGIS software and PostgreSQL QGIS (postgreAdmin) software 
        for all. Actually it is recommended to use the open source one. <br>
        ? A client-Server GeoNode system either (Linux or desktop system) <br>
        ? A Client-Server pgAdmin postgreSQL system<br>
        3) A desktop computers for all Central and Regions UEAP&#8217;s offices 
        which have a great capacity, good speed performance and enough RAM size 
        specification.<br>
        4) GPS instruments.<br>
        ? A handheld device GPS Instrument with latest map built in. ie. Garmin-60 
        GPS (recommended).<br>
        ? Smart Mobile Phones using ODK Software or using OSM Trucker software 
        (optional).<br>
        5) Data storage devices (big memory size like 4TB is recommended).</font></p>

        There are a lot of satellites revolving the earth 20180 km above sea level. 
        A GPS (Global Positioning System) device is an instrument, which works 
        through trilateration method, used get the geographic position of an object 
        by the help of those satellites revolving the earth with their own orbits 
        in sustainable manner. This device works based on calculating at list 
        three reference position of satellites with their respective distance 
        from the earth, the time take for the signal from those satellites to 
        the receiver (GPS Mobile or GPS device) and the speed of light. This process 
        repeats through consecutive period in each single steps of our movement 
        with the device.</font></p>

        There is also a big receiver on the earth to receive the satellites signals 
        and retransmit back and forward to the satellites and horizontally for 
        different Mobile receivers to capture an object position accurately with 
        less error. But in the case of only GPS device and satellites communication 
        no need to communicate the earth satellite receiver. <br>

        The nature of LV network asset of EEU is sophisticated and more complex 
        as compared to HV and MV network. A little quit to be focus during data 
        collection is important in order to minimize different types of errors. 
        Whatever types of GPS instruments (either Garmin-60 handheld GPS instruments 
        or Smart Mobile Phones or Total Station) that we use, there is a need 
        to wait until the device to communicate with three or more satellites 
        so as to get best strong signals to decrease the error deviation. The 
        setting for the GPS devices or smart Phones should be set in standard 
        mode which is mostly data in WGS 1984, in degree-minute- second in geographic 
        and with datum WGS 1984 Addendum Zone 36N,37N,38N UTM in meter positioning 
        format. <br>
        Among these LV network components Dead End point, T-off, 2T-off, Section

      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"><br>
        During LV network survey, we will collect the route line along the road 
        or rail ways which has a small deviation from the original construction 
        location. If there a need to have detail LV network information in Towns/Villages 
        Roads, LV existing lines, houses, Other basic Load points etc., can be 
        captured on site, and also put on the detail profile drawings. If there 
        are side slopes affecting the dimensioning of the poles, this shall be 
        clearly marked by measuring the ground profile also max. 2 meters aside 
        of the line route. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"><br>
        There is a possibility for the LV line passes through mountainous and 
        hilly areas. In such situations we can stop trucking at foot point and 
        continuing trucking at top when it becomes closest to the road.<br>
        Pole Spoting: The pole spotting can be made on the profile drawings for 
        the specific Towns/Villages if necessary by using suitable templates. 
        Stacking charts must also be prepared. For the LV network survey, suitable 
        town maps, existing drawings and the site handover report can be used 
        as a guid to make the survey more easy.<br>

        It is a rapid, thorough and exhaustive survey conducted to examine the 
        entire area through which the existing line may pass. It is the key step 
        to the project and a series of walk-over surveys are conducted carefully 
        to determine the best way in order capture the truck closest to the existing 
        network by observing and evaluating all possible mechanisms. The observation 
        includes topography, geological nature, drainage characteristics (swampyness), 
        forest, towns, other existing situation of the area and any obstacle that 
        restricting us no to follow the line route.<br>

      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"><br>
        Sometimes it may necessary to have detail LV network survey. From the 
        reconnaissance survey along the most suitable route, detail instrumental 
        survey is conducted to prepare accurate topographic map (plan and profile) 
        of the selected route by measuring distance, height, horizontal angles 
        and GPS data. In this stage profile and plan of the route are plotted 
        on paper to a suitable scale. Then by study the terrain conditions, pole 
        spotting shall be made on plan profile drawings. The following should 
        be taken into account during pole spotting. We should have to keep ground 
        clearance. Here are some examples.<br>
        ? Hilly area: pole should be spotted on the peak of hill / mountain irrespective 
        of the span. <br>
        ? Valley area: Poles should not spotted at depression area and such location 
        shall be crossed by bridging a single span.<br>
        For all cases show in below map, the straight line trucking has no matter 
        in order to capture the existing network line, which has less error as 
        compared to the original one. The following pictures shows us possible 
        condition likely to happen on the field. </font><br>

        and services. The process includes preparation and processing of a demand 
        as well as the end receipt and approval of payment. It often involves 
        purchase planning, standards determination, specifications development, 
        supplier research and selection, value analysis, financing, price negotiation, 
        making the purchase, supply contract administration, inventory control 
        and stores, and disposals and other related functions. The process of 
        procurement is often part of a company's strategy because the ability 
        to purchase certain materials will determine if operations will continue. 
        <br>
        The UEAP procurement department should prepare the preliminary and final 
        procurement documents based on ICB (International Competitive Bidding) 
        or LIB (Limited International Bidding) according to the specification 
        of the devices and softwares checked by the consultant. This department 
        should have to meet the need of the project on schedule. The project will 
        not be able to survive if it's price of procurement is more than the profit 
        it makes on the system. <br>
        There are two types of standard bidding methods. ie ICB (International 
        Competitive Bidding) and LIB (Limited International Bidding).<br>

      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">The objective of international competitive bidding 
        (ICB), as described in these Guidelines, is to provide all eligible prospective 
        bidders with timely and adequate notification of a borrower&#8217;s requirements 
        and an equal opportunity to bid for the required goods and works. The 
        bidding documents shall clearly state the type of contract to be entered 
        into and contain the proposed contract provisions appropriate therefore. 
        The most common types of contracts provide for payments on the basis of 
        a lump sum or unit prices, or combinations thereof. The size and scope 
        of individual contracts will depend on the magnitude, nature, and location 
        of the project. For projects requiring a variety of goods and works, separate 
        contracts generally are awarded for the supply and/or installation of 
        different items of devices and softwares. For a project requiring similar 
        but separate items of equipment or works, bids may be invited under alternative 
        contract options that would attract the interest of both small and large 
        firms, which could be allowed, at their option, to bid for individual 
        contracts (slices) or for a group of similar contracts (package). All 
        bids and combinations of bids shall be received by the same deadline and 
        opened and evaluated simultaneously so as to determine the bid or combination 
        of bids offering the lowest evaluated cost to the borrower.<br>

		<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Limited international bidding (LIB) is essentially 
        ICB by direct invitation without open advertisement where it would not 
        be the most economic and efficient method of procurement. It may also 
        be an appropriate method of procurement where there is only a limited 
        number of suppliers, the amount of the contract is not large enough to 
        attract foreign suppliers and contractors through ICB, or other exceptional 
        reasons may justify departure from full ICB procedures. Under LIB, borrowers 
        shall seek bids from a list of potential suppliers broad enough to assure 
        competitive prices, such list to include all suppliers when there are 
        only a limited number. Domestic preferences are not applicable in the 
        evaluation of bids under LIB.<br>
